Hey everyone üëã

I am open sourcing my freelancing project by which i was able to earn _$5000+ in just 2 months of work_, and that too when i just started working for a full time web dev job for Rs 35000/month in year 2020 _(after failing for 4 consecutive years (2015-2019) of giving medical entrance examination and then, doing a 6 months web dev internship for Rs 15000/month stipend)_.

This just shocked me and made me reliased the power of freelancing and how much money you can earn by doing freelancing.

**I am open sourcing this project because i want to help other developers who are struggling to get their first freelancing client or first dev job. I want to help them by providing a ready to use project which they can use to show their skills to their clients or future employers and get their first client or first dev job.**

I created this management system for a canadian painting company. Today, all his company's day to day operations which includes Payrolls, Expenses, Invoices generation, Estimates generation, Time Tracking, Production Calendar, client emailing etc... are managed by this system. So, yeah it's not a toy project and it's not a simple CRUD app either üòÖ as its been used actively in real life scenerio üòâ.
